# A VR analytics framework to assess the user experience of digital twins
A Turing-Manchester Feasibility Project 

Duration: April â€“ September, 2022

### Goal
Digital twins are often represented through Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) models. The experience with such models has typically been evaluated qualitatively, which yields an in-depth understanding but lacks breadth and is costly. Currently, tool support for quantitatively evaluating immersive models VR/AR is lacking and measuring the immersive experience is still an open research question. Therefore, we do not know if digital twins are serving their intended purpose.  

In this project we will address this gap by developing an affordable VR/AR experimental framework for testing hypotheses in immersive environments including digital twins.
